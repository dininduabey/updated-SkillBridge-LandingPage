## SkillBridge Demo
This repository contains the frontend demo for the SkillBridge job recommendation system. It showcases an interactive user interface designed to help users discover relevant job opportunities based on skills, preferences, and profile data.

## Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the job matching algorithm through a responsive and modern web interface. It includes dynamic components, reusable UI elements, and smooth navigation for an optimal user experience.

## Tech Stack:
This project is built with the following modern technologies:

1. React – A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
2. TypeScript – Strongly-typed JavaScript for scalable, maintainable code
3. Vite – Fast and lightweight development server and build tool
4. Tailwind CSS – Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
5. shadcn/ui – Beautifully designed React components built with Radix UI and Tailwind
